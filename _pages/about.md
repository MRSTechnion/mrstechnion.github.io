The **Multi-Robot Systems** (MRS) lab aims to endow individual robots and multi-robot teams with theory-driven and practical algorithms for tackling complex tasks. Our work explores fundamental questions in, e.g., control, planning, coordination, as well as applications in areas such as autonomous racing and driving, smart mobility, and disaster relief. We draw inspiration from various domains, including mathematics, computational sciences (optimization and artificial intelligence), and engineering (robotics, control, and transportation science), and rigorously test our ideas in theory and on physical hardware.

The lab is headed by Prof. [Kiril Solovey](https://kirilsol.github.io) from the faculty of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.technion.ac.il/), who is affiliated with [Tech.AI](https://tech-ai.technion.ac.il/), the [Autonomous Systems Program](https://tasp.technion.ac.il/), and the [Applied Mathematics Program](https://math.technion.ac.il/labs/applied-math/en/). We host the Technion [F1TENTH team](/f1tenth/) who develop autonomous racecars for head-to-head racing.
